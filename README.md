My name is Junior Yohan Sordo Garc√≠a and I am a computer engineer and programmer. I specialize in the development of web applications and virtual reality with innovative technologies. I have experience as a frontend developer, using Nextjs and Reactjs to create dynamic and responsive websites. I also have knowledge of Unreal Engine 5, a graphic engine that allows creating high-quality interactive experiences. I have worked with Blueprint and C++ to program the logic and user interface of Unreal Designe and Unreal Designe VR projects.
